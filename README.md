This bot was originally written for the Monster Hunter Online discord.  It will probably be abandoned, but I want a project to work on so I am going to continue it.

#Current features:

- Leveling with PM notifications (Now disabled by default. You will need to enable notifications by using the command "#notify" to toggle them.)
- Inventory that gains random items every level.  Currently there are 38 possible inventory items.
- Now shows what items you gain on level.
- Zenny gained every level (doesn't have a use right now.  It's not a top priority.) 
- Show inventory command that shows items you have in an embed. (Now only displays one embed with all your items.)
- Show player info command.
- Throw things at your friends. Or just throw things in general!
