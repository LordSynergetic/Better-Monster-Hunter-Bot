- Monsters may become angry.
- Monster anger is triggered the same way as dealing damage, with a different random trigger.
- Monsters may be trapped making it easier to hit them with bombs.
- Bombs do damage to monsters.
- Successfully hitting a monster with a Dung Bomb will cause it to flee to a different channel that has toggled unstable and does not currently have a monster (This is global)
- Every 3 minutes monsters in the channel will do a random amount of damage to any player that has hurt it based on the amount of damage the player has done.
