This bot was originally written for the Monster Hunter Online discord.  It will probably be abandoned, but I want a project to work on so I am going to continue it.

#Current features:

- Leveling with PM notifications (Apparently everyone hates this.  Going to make it disabled by default and make an opt in command.)
- Inventory that gains random items every level.  Currently there are 38 possible inventory items.
- Zenny gained every level (doesn't have a use right now.  It's not a top priority.) 
- Show inventory command that shows items you have in an embed.  (Need this to be one embed so it's not rate limited.  Going to do away with icons I guess for this.)
